//! # steno-core
//!
//! The platform-neutral brain of anysteno. It has **no I/O and no GUI/OS
//! dependencies**, so it is identical on Linux, Windows and macOS and is fully
//! unit-tested with `cargo test`.
//!
//! Pipeline (data flows top to bottom):
//!
//! ```text
//!   physical key events
//!         │
//!   [chord]      accumulate simultaneous presses -> one chord on full release
//!         │
//!   [layout]     physical key -> steno key id
//!         │
//!   [stroke]     steno keys -> canonical stroke string (e.g. "KAT")
//!         │
//!   [dictionary] stroke(s) -> output text (greedy longest match)
//!         │
//!   [engine]     ties it together, produces translations for the app
//! ```
//!
//! A **language pack** ([`Pack`]) bundles a [`Layout`] + [`Dictionary`] + meta.
//! Adding a language never requires a recompile — drop a pack folder in the
//! user config dir. Two official packs ship embedded (see [`defaults`]).
//!
//! ## Teaching, not just translating
//!
//! Everything needed to *learn* a pack is decidable without a screen, so it
//! lives here too and is unit-tested alongside the engine:
//!
//! * [`reverse`] — the dictionary read backwards ([`ReverseIndex`]): text → the
//!   strokes that write it, with a deterministic choice when a word has several
//!   spellings. Backs stroke hints and dictionary search.
//! * [`lesson`] — [`Curriculum::derive`] generates a progression from a pack
//!   alone, so a new language needs no hand-written lesson plan; [`Drill`] runs
//!   one.
//! * [`stats`] — [`SessionStats`]: words per minute and accuracy. Clock-free —
//!   the caller supplies elapsed time, keeping `std::time` out of the core.
//!
//! [`stroke::parse_stroke`] is the inverse of [`stroke::render_stroke`]: it
//! recovers the keys a stroke is made of, which is what lets a UI show *which
//! keys to press* and what makes it checkable that a dictionary entry can be
//! chorded at all.
